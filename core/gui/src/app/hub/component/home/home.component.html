      <h2>Cloud-based Computing Platform for Diabetes Research</h2>
      <p>
        This cloud-based computing platform, powered by Texera, brings data science and AI/ML to the diabetes research
        community and facilitates interdisciplinary collaborations among users. By enabling a GUI-based workflow
        interface, it allows diabetes researchers, including those with limited or no coding skills, to participate in
        the life cycle of a data science project and use the latest AI/ML technology. It also allows experienced IT
        experts to implement their custom logic using their favorite programming languages.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Strengths</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaborative functionalities:</strong> It supports features such as real-time shared editing, shared
          execution, version control, commenting, and debugging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multi-language support:</strong> It supports multiple script languages such as Python, R, Java, and
          Scala. This flexibility accommodates different programming preferences and facilitates the adoption of
          advanced AI/ML techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Elasticity and reproducibility:</strong> It allows users to elastically request computing resources
          from public clouds (e.g., Amazon AWS) to form clusters to conduct computationally expensive tasks and enjoy
          the pay-as-you-go model.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sharing:</strong> The platform allows community users to publish their data sets and workflows, and
          choose the collaborators to share the resources with.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following is a screenshot of a workflow being edited by two collaborators.</p>
